Hello Everyone,
The MERN stack has a lot of advantages in a web application and so I decided to start exploring more to put together a small practice project.
I learned how CRUD operations work in order to manipulate data from an API.
Also, learned how to store data in mongoDB and creating schemas through mongoose.
Next, I will be creating a full-stack web application and give updates on github very soon.
Cant wait to start building!
